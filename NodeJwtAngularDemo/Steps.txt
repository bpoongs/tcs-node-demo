Backend application - > 
	- generates the jwt token
	- verifies the jwt token

Frontend application -> 
	- once authenticated , it receives the jwt token from backend application
	- the jwt is stored in session storage
	- for every subsequest http request to the back end application
	   the token is attached as Authorization header and the request is sent

Backend application ->
- verifies the token at each endpoint
- if authorization header is not present, return null
- if authorization header is present, but token is tampered , then jwt.verify() 
	will throw an error
- based on what is returned from the back end application ( null or error or data)
	decide what should be done in front end application ( navigate to login or
	displa the data received from back end application)
