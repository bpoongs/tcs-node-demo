For preparing an application for production-level serving 
the API, uWSGI and NGINX can be used. Docker makes it
 easy to have everything put together in the same 
 container and prevents you from having to install 
 everything from scratch every time that you would
  put your application to run.

NGINX is the web server and reverse proxy, 
that passes requests on to uWSGI.

uWSGI is an application server, which 
can communicate with the web server for
 receiving requests and forwards them to
  Flask via the WSGI protocol.

The set up shown here is very minimal,
 and not suited for handling large 
 amounts of simultaneous requests. 
 However, this architecture is able 
 to scale, and for this, it would
only require tweaking the configuration files.
